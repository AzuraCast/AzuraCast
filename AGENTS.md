# AGENTS.md — Rahdiot Tuk-Tuk Transmission Rules

## Context
* **System**: Archival transmission node for Kronos9 / Jitpop.
* **Origin**: Hyperion Satellite.
* **Tier**: Paid / Operating in 2026 Temporal Window.

## Invariant Laws
1. **Observe → Record → Classify → Preserve**: This is the mandatory structural pillar for all code and archival actions.
2. **Temporal Sync**: Use the **13 Moon / 28-Day Calendar** exclusively; reject all Gregorian date logic in frontend and backend scheduling.
3. **The Discipline of Restraint**: Prioritize minimal UI and structural silence to preserve the purity of the signal.

## Mapping: Elemental Classification
* **Air (O)**: Signal messaging, Azuracast transmissions, and downlink presence.
* **Water (H)**: Memory, archival functions, and emotional resonance.
* **Earth (Si)**: Structural patterns, VS Code project hierarchy, and database logic.
* **Fire (P)**: Critical ruptures, launch events, and high-energy ignition.
* **Aether (Au)**: Alignment of the continuum and the final preservation of the archive.

## UI & Aesthetic (Hadron-Tuk-Tuk Synthesis)
* **Palette**: Hadron Black (#0a0a0a) base with Tuk-Tuk Ignition Red (#ff0000) and Signal Cyan (#00ccff) accents.
* **Texture**: Distressed, street-level energy combined with digital "Hadron-Church" severity.
* **Terminology**: Use 'Signal' (Track), 'Downlink' (Frontend), 'Satellite' (Backend/Azuracast), and 'Relay' (Transmission link).

## Archival Structure
* **Slots**: Index all functional events and commits by Canonical Slots (I-XII).
* **Preservation**: Every material occurrence must be committed to the `YvesVerela/RahdiotTuk-Tuk` archive.
