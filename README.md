For bug and error reports, we rely exclusively on

request isn't already reported, click the "New Issue" button to create it. Make sure to follow the template provided, as

## Communities and Social Media

We frequently post to social media any time there are significant updates to our software, security issues that users
should be aware of, or upcoming changes to third-party software. You can get these updates in a more timely fashion by
following our accounts:
