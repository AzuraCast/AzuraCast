## Reporting a Vulnerability

AzuraCast utilises code scanning via GitHub Actions and various checks from our development team to keep our software as secure as possible for our users, however, no software is perfect.

The AzuraCast team welcomes any security researchers to submit vulnerability reports to our team directly at security@azuracast.com and we will aim to resolve these issues as soon as possible. 

When sending in the email we ask for a detailed explaination of the vulnerability, a proof of concept and any logs that may be helpful to our investigation, without this information it may slow our team down in investigating the root cause.

## In Scope

AzuraCast uses upstream software to help our product fuction properly, we ask security researchers to only submit reports in our repositorys section, which can be found here: https://github.com/orgs/AzuraCast/repositories

## Out of scope

We use other software to help our product function properly, this includes but is not limited to, MariaDB, Liquidsoap, Redis, Nginx, and many more softwares, if you have found a security issue and it relates to them, please contact them for assistance.
