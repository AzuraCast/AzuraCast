# whether your installation is a production or development instance.
# Valid options: debug, info, notice, warning, error, critical, alert, emergency
# LOG_LEVEL=notice

# Enable the composer "merge" functionality to combine the main application's

# (and nginx, if you want to use the built-in port-80/443 proxy)!
